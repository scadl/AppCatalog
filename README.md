# AppCatalog
One of omy oldest php apps, from the times I only learned how to work with databases from php. It's nothing special - two simple db tables, 3 scripts: for index, login and edit\add. The users db even hasn't encryption, so you can esely see defualt users password from db editor. 

It's primary intended to be beginners learning materail for php novices (like I was that time). Do not copy-paste this code into productuin, becuause it's really unsecure!
